# Titanic Survival Prediction ðŸš¢

This project uses **Logistic Regression** to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features like age, class, fare, and gender.
Files Included

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `Titanic_Prediction.ipynb` | Colab notebook with data cleaning, model training, evaluation, and visualization |
| `titanic.csv` | Dataset used (optional if hosted elsewhere) |
| `titanic_logistic_model.pkl` | Trained Logistic Regression model saved using `joblib` |
Features Used
- Passenger Class (`Pclass`)
- Age
- Gender (`Sex`)
- Siblings/Spouses aboard (`SibSp`)
- Parents/Children aboard (`Parch`)
- Fare
- Embarked port
 Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
Visualizations
- Survival Rate (bar chart, pie chart)
- Survival by Gender
- Survival by Class
- Age Distribution by Survival
How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter
2. Upload `titanic.csv`
3. Run all cells to see model training, evaluation, and predictions
Model Use
You can load the model and predict like this:
```python
import joblib
model = joblib.load('titanic_logistic_model.pkl')
sample = [[3, 22.0, 1, 0, 7.25, 1, 2]]
print(model.predict(sample))
